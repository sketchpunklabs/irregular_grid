 // Visually see the ray cast, ray cast the vertex then grab all the edges + faces attached, use the center point
 // of all the faces to represet the "tile shape" but all you do is activate that point, then you fill in the quads

 Here's my trick to try make quads square: 
force = 0
for(i< 4){
 force += verts[i] - center
 force = (force .y,-force .x)}

for(i < 4){
 forces[i]  += center + force - verts[i]
 force = (force.y,-force .x)}
